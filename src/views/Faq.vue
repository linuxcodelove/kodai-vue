                "Planning succeeds in executing. That way after planning everything about exploring Kodaikanal but ended up being stuck in how to reach Kodaikanal and the way to reach your favourite hotspot?.As there are not much trains available to reach Kodaikanal most of the visitors prefer traveling in their private vehicles or cab services or public transports as per its availability. Kodai Road, situated around 80 km away from the main town of Kodaikanal, is the nearest railway station. Mostly trains from Madurai and Trichy run to Kodai Road. This is the only railway station in Kodaikanal for all its visitors. Its hilly geographic location makes it a little difficult for trains to reach and the travel by cabs and other services are not bad, rather it's more valuable and helps explore Kodaikanal to a maximum extent. There are 21 hairpin bends through the path of Kodaikanal which makes your journey more adventurous,",
